# Changelog

All notable changes to Easel are documented in this file.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Added a unified **Settings panel** in the workbench (模型配置 · 环境安装 · 更多设置). Model configuration is now editable in the browser across all six channels (chat / transcribe / image / video / music / speech): edit provider, model, Base URL and API key, add custom providers, switch primary/backup, and run a real self-test that reports actual handshake latency. Saving writes to `.env`; keys are returned masked and an empty key field means "leave unchanged".
- Added a runtime **environment installer** (`install_tool.py`) plus an in-panel 环境安装 page: local engines are health-checked for real, installed in the background, and their status is written back as the job progresses.
- Added read-back reconciliation to Bilibili upload: after posting, the member submission API is queried directly and the run only counts as successful if the read-back matches.
- Added `vendor/VENDOR.md` recording the provenance of the bundled `video-pipeline-sdk` (upstream, version, local modifications, how to resync).

### Improved

- Improved conversation latency: the Web chat now talks to the resident gateway over its OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint instead of spawning a thin `openclaw agent` client every turn, saving roughly 3s per turn (measured on Linux: 7.6s → 4.5s end-to-end). Transport is pinned per session and never switches mid-conversation, so history is never silently dropped. Set `EASEL_CHAT_TRANSPORT=cli` to return to the old path.
- Improved responsiveness of the outputs library: `/api/outputs` moved to a thread pool so a full product-tree scan no longer blocks the event loop.
- Improved CI coverage: the suite now runs `pytest` instead of `pytest tests/`, so the 38 skill-bundled tests under `skills/**/tests/` actually run in CI.

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows installation on PowerShell 5.1, where `setup.ps1` failed outright during the configuration-writing stage (issue #41).
- Fixed workspace resolution: `sync.sh`, `setup.ps1`, `doctor` and the video pipeline each hard-coded a different workspace path, so on the other OpenClaw layout they wrote to a directory the agent never reads — while still reporting success. All four now ask OpenClaw itself for its runtime `workspaceDir` (issue #19).
- Fixed a placeholder API key in `.env.example` silently disabling the whole OpenAI-compatible branch of `setup.sh`, which produced a config with no provider while `doctor` still reported all green. `doctor` now verifies that the primary model's provider actually has credentials.
- Fixed the HTML preview in the content library: the built-in「复制到公众号」button now works inside the preview drawer, and the preview always renders the latest version instead of a heuristically cached one.
- Fixed images breaking after pasting into WeChat: local images referenced by a preview are inlined as base64 data-URIs, so the bytes travel with the clipboard instead of requiring WeChat to fetch a local Easel URL.
- Fixed `install_tool.py` crashing under non-UTF-8 locales on Windows, which left the install endpoint with an empty id allowlist and made the 环境安装 page reject every tool.
- Fixed domestic-platform publishing to fall back to a direct connection (Chromium-level `--no-proxy-server`), so it works with a VPN enabled.
- Fixed `scripts/gateway.ps1` missing its UTF-8 BOM — the only Chinese-containing `.ps1` without one, which PowerShell 5.1 decoded using the system ANSI code page.

### Security

- Hardened the settings and install endpoints: the install id allowlist is derived from the engine's own recipe table, and settings writes are validated server-side.
- Closed a command-injection hole in `.env` writes. The previous guard only rejected newlines, but `setup.sh` sources `.env`, so a non-newline value such as `KEY=$(id)` still reached bash's command substitution. Values are now restricted to the character set these fields actually need.
- Added a Content-Security-Policy to the 公众号 preview page. The preview iframe needs `allow-scripts` for its copy button, and an opaque origin is not enough protection because the Web API is CORS-open and unauthenticated — reproduced in a real browser, a script embedded in generated content could call a local endpoint and read the response. `connect-src 'none'` now blocks that exfiltration path while leaving the copy button and image rendering intact.

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/Easel/releases/tag/v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Added the `video-production` Skill: an end-to-end video pipeline (probe → transcribe → scenes → design table → scaffold → verify → preview → render → deliver) with two human confirmation gates and quality gates (five-piece manifest, loudness, transitions). The upstream `video-pipeline-sdk` (MIT) is now vendored into the repo so the pipeline is self-contained, reproducible, and editable. Skill count is now 114.
- Added three-tier transcription with automatic fallback: SRT/VTT subtitles first, then SiliconFlow ASR API, then local whisper as a last resort — so a run no longer requires downloading the 3GB model when a transcript or API key is available.
- Added a **「笔」capability menu** to the workbench input area: click to browse everything Easel can do ("能做的都在这"); selecting an item prefills the prompt.
- Added a ffmpeg-based slideshow renderer for image-storyboard voiceover dramas (Ken Burns, differentiated transitions, libass dynamic captions, light whoosh SFX, loudnorm).

### Improved

- Improved the Skill library display: Chinese display names shown large with the original name beneath, kept in sync across search and the drawer.
- Improved in-conversation cards to support multi-select (`ask_user` multiSelect rendering and multi-value submission).
- Improved file uploads: files exceeding the upload limit are automatically converted to local materials via a copy channel (without changing the 50MB config).
- Improved reasoning visibility: `--thinking` now defaults to medium so chain-of-thought shows when the gateway supports it.

### Fixed

- Fixed chain-of-thought (CoT) display in the Web conversation: token/thinking now streams token-by-token, and the anti-stall heartbeat no longer overrides real status.
- Fixed the Gemini adapter to support `streamGenerateContent` streaming.
- Fixed UTF-8 persistence on Windows (state read/write) and migrated the shutdown hook to a lifespan handler.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/Easel/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Added WeChat Official Account (公众号) support: article publishing, Data Center metrics, and account management via a background QR-scan session.
- Added an optional vendored typesetting Skill (`gzh-design`, AGPL-3.0), bringing the Skill count to 113.

### Improved

- Improved the workbench **创作数据** panel: Bilibili and Douyin now populate "近 7 日 · 环比" (7-day metrics with week-over-week change) and "最近作品" (recent works).
  - Bilibili reads the creator overview API for play/like/comment/favorite/share/follower deltas, and lists recent uploads (title/link/cover/stats).
  - Douyin parses the real "近 7 日" labels with a section anchor to avoid mis-reading the "最新作品" card, handles the "较前7日±X" delta format, hardens polling stability, and scrapes recent works from the content-manage page.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenClaw version detection in `easel doctor` on Windows (the `.cmd` shim cannot be invoked bare).
- Fixed cross-platform gateway/launcher robustness and Xiaohongshu login navigation races.
